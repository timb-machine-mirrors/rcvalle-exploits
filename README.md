========


* [OpenSSL Alternative Chains Certificate Forgery MITM Proxy](https://github.com/rcvalle/exploits/raw/HEAD/openssl_altchainsforgery_mitm_proxy.rb)  
  The X509_verify_cert function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1n, 1.0.1o, 1.0.2b, and 1.0.2c does not properly process X.509 Basic Constraints cA values during identification of alternative certificate chains, which allows remote attackers to spoof a Certification Authority role and trigger unintended certificate verifications via a valid leaf certificate.

* [OpenSSL Alternative Certificate Chain Validation Logic Error (a.k.a. Alternative Chains Certificate Forgery) MITM Proxy/Exploit](https://github.com/rcvalle/exploits/raw/HEAD/rcvalle_accforgery.rb)  
  The X509_verify_cert function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1n, 1.0.1o, 1.0.2b, and 1.0.2c does not properly process X.509 Basic Constraints cA values during identification of alternative certificate chains, which allows remote attackers to spoof a Certification Authority role and trigger unintended certificate verifications via a valid leaf certificate.
